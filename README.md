# JavaScript Bug: Null Value Handling in foo Function

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to the handling of null values in a function. The `foo` function does not properly handle cases where either `a` or `b` is null, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function is designed to perform some operation on the values `a` and `b`. However, it fails to explicitly handle scenarios where either `a` or `b` is null. This leads to issues, particularly if these values are received from external sources that might not always be populated.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves adding explicit checks for null values before proceeding with the core function's logic. By handling the null cases, the function is made more robust and less prone to errors.
